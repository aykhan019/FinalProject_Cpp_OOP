# C++ OOP Final Project (Restaruant Management System)

## Overview
This project is a C++ application that simulates a restaurant management system. It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, file handling, and error management. The program allows users to place orders, manage menus, and process restaurant operations efficiently.

## Features
- **Order Management**: Place, view, and cancel orders.
- **Menu Handling**: Add, remove, and update menu items.
- **File Handling**: Orders are saved in external files for persistent storage.
- **Error Logging**: Detailed error management with log files.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language for the application.
- **OOP Concepts**: Class-based structure, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **File Handling**: Read/write operations to manage orders and error logs.
- **Music Integration**: Background music for a more interactive user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio).
- **IDE**: You can use any IDE, such as Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aykhan019/FinalProject_Cpp_OOP.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Build the solution and run the project.

### Running the Application
1. After building the project, execute the `OOP_FinalProject_Cpp.exe` file.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the restaurant system.

## Project Structure
- `Source.cpp`: Main file containing the entry point of the application.
- `Classes.h`: Contains the class definitions for various components like Menu, Order, etc.
- `FileHelper.h`: Manages file operations such as reading and writing to order files.
- `ErrorFile.txt`: Logs errors encountered during execution.
